Things learnt:
- beveling on edit mode (Blender), (ctrl+shift+B). Use scroll-wheel to increase bevel segments.
- An introduction to UV unwrapping on Blender. I still need practice on this as it is not as straightforward as it seems.
- Loading 3D models from Blender to the web using the Three.js glft loader.
- using GSAP (https://greensock.com/gsap/) to animate the imported model within the browser
